# Mutiplier-of-extremely-long-polynomials-via-parallel-computing-


coding languages and tools: C++, OpenCL, Visual Studio

This project provides a parallel-computing software that mutiplies two extremely long polynomials on multi-core CPU and GPU. The software takes coefficients of two polynomials. And it calculates the coefficient of the product polynomial, based on our parallel version of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
