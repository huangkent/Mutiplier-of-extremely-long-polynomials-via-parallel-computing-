# Mutiplier-of-extremely-long-polynomials-via-parallel-computing-
This project provides a parallel-computing software that mutiplies two extremely long polynomials on multi-core CPU and GPU. The software takes coefficients of two polynomials. And it calculates the coefficient of the product polynomial, based on our parallel version of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The software was implemented using OpenCL and C++ on Visural Studio.
